Originally a joint project with Dobo Radichnov for CX 311 (Artificial Intelligence) at Middlebury.


SOURCE CODE
Source code can be compile with GCC.  Version 3.4.x or 4.x is recommended.  Can be compile under Linux, Cygwin, or MinGW (Windows/DOS).


USAGE:
This is a command-line program, i.e. it need to run in a console window (or DOS window for Windows).  Use "--help" switch to see a full list of options. 


ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
This is still an elementary level program, low search speed, manually tuned (and hence inaccurate) evaluation funcion.  Therefore it is pretty weak and definitely no match for good Othello programs such as WZebra, Pointy Stone, etc.  However it is should be a good challenge for beginning and amateur level players.
